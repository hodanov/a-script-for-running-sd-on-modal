# A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
# NumPy 2.0.0 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
# versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
# Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

# If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
# downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
# We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.
